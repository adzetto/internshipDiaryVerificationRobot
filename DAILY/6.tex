\textbf{Morning Activities (09:00 – 12:00):} I reviewed the METEL Surface Protection and DEMARC Construction progress payment drawings and files for the same ISDEMIR Port job under the “Rehabilitation and Improvement of Earthquake-Damaged Port Structures” scope. I established a clear project narrative summarizing the port-wide objective (rehabilitating slabs, joints and coatings; channels, pipes and drainage; rail and crane operation lines including beam–sleeper and pile–beam connections). I mapped all position items (poz) to their A/B/C figures using the green ledger logic (A = Total Executed, B = Previous Total, C = This Period) and cross-checked the measured quantities against the referenced drawings. The key drivers identified were: high axle and wheel loads, repeated dynamic effects, and marine exposure (chlorides, impact), which together demand stiffness, continuity, safety, durability and maintainability.

\textbf{Afternoon Activities (13:00 – 17:00):} I drafted paragraph-style technical rationales, item by item, explaining what each contractor does and why the work is required technically.
\emph{METEL — Slab Concrete and Joints.} POZ-01 (35 cm finisher-placed slab, m$^2$; A $\approx$ 20{,}991; B $\approx$ 18{,}577; C $\approx$ 2{,}414): thickness provides bending and punching safety under heavy operational loads; finisher improves flatness and drainage. POZ-02 (Shrinkage/construction joint saw-cut and seal, m; A $\approx$ 7{,}790; B $\approx$ 4{,}810; C $\approx$ 2{,}980): saw-cutting controls random cracking; sealants (bitumen, PU/polysulfide) provide flexibility and watertightness; typical depth 25–33\% of thickness. POZ-03 (Expansion joint, m; A $\approx$ 1{,}772; B $\approx$ 1{,}552; C $\approx$ 220): continuous filler and elastomeric seal accommodate thermal movements. YBF-01 (Auxiliary labor, ea; A = 49; B = 49; C = 0): supports cleaning, joint prep and curing. YBF-02 (Hot bitumen filling, m; A $\approx$ 1{,}564; B = 0; C $\approx$ 1{,}564): economical, elastic sealing, resistant to fuels/chemicals.
\emph{DEMARC — Concrete, Infrastructure and Rail/Operation Lines.} Formwork-1/2/3/4 (m$^2$; e.g., F-2 $\approx$ 5{,}481; F-3 $\approx$ 2{,}362; F-4 $\approx$ 5{,}529): dimensional accuracy, surface quality and cover; over-water (F-1) requires extra rigidity/anchorage. Concrete-1/2/3 (m$^3$; A $\approx$ 3{,}378; $\approx$ 2{,}272; $\approx$ 2{,}316): includes superstructure elements, beams/caps and channel bases; plan logistics and vibration to avoid cold joints; low w/c and strict curing for durability in marine exposure. Reinforcement-1…6 (t): reinforcement for manholes/channels, general elements, precast, bored piles, slabs/mesh providing crack control, ductility and fatigue resistance. Pipe-1 (Cast iron pipe in concrete Ø50–Ø200, m; A $\approx$ 637): safe routing with sealing and vibration control. Misc-1 (Anchor assembly, kg; A $\approx$ 162{,}335): load transfer for steel structures, bollards/fenders; embedment and plate thickness sized for tension/shear/moment. Misc-2 (XPS/foam, m$^2$; A $\approx$ 1{,}282): void formers/expansion fillers or thermal-moisture barrier. Misc-3 (Grout, m$^3$; A = 12.78): non-shrink, flowable grout ensures full bearing and load transfer at machinery bases and pile caps. Misc-4 (Waterstop, m; A $\approx$ 2{,}224): PVC/TPR bands for watertightness under internal/external head. YBF-01 (Rail sleeper assembly, kg; A $\approx$ 8{,}292): track geometry stability, vibration/noise control and load transfer. YBF-02 (Crane foundation pile head breaking, ea; A = 35): brings pile tops to design elevation for monolithic connection. YBF-03 (Ø400 corrugated pipe, m; A $\approx$ 710): stormwater conveyance with correct bedding, cover and manhole ties.

\textbf{Joint Application Notes:} Saw cuts at about 10–15 MPa early-age concrete strength (often 12–24 h after casting), with typical depth 25–33% of slab thickness. Construction joints use dowels/tie bars and, where needed, waterstops for continuity and watertightness. Expansion joints use continuous fillers and elastomeric seals; backer-rod helps achieve proper seal geometry. Sealant choice must withstand fuels, oils, UV and salts; hot bitumen is fast and economical, elastomeric sealants accommodate larger movements and chemicals. Proper cleaning, priming and masking are essential to avoid bond failure.

\textbf{Integrated Rationale:} In a port environment combining heavy axle loads, repeated dynamics, marine/chemical exposure and continuous operations, the slab joint strategy, drainage and cable/energy corridors, and rail/crane beam–sleeper–anchor details must work as a system to ensure strength, durability and service continuity.

\textbf{Today’s Deliverable (Office):} I re-measured and validated quantities against the drawings and linked them to A/B/C in the green ledger, focusing on drawing–quantity–payment consistency, joint layout principles and hydraulic continuity of drainage lines.
\end{workcontent}

\begin{skillslearned}
\item[] I developed proficiency in reading A/B/C logic in progress payments and aligning drawings with the green ledger system. I learned joint design choices for slabs including optimal cutting timing, depth specifications, and sealant selection criteria. I gained understanding of durability measures for marine-exposed concrete including low water-cement ratios, proper curing techniques, and capillary control methods. I grasped load transfer and fatigue concepts in rail beam–sleeper–anchor details and their structural implications. I mastered drainage execution details including corrugated pipe installation, manhole construction, bedding and cover requirements, and watertightness measures using waterstop and grout systems.
\end{skillslearned}

\begin{challenges}
\item[] Harmonizing drawing, quantity, and payment records across multiple versions while tracking previous-period deductions presented significant coordination challenges. Optimizing joint sealant systems, particularly choosing between hot bitumen versus elastomeric options based on chemical exposure and maintenance requirements, demanded careful technical analysis. Planning concrete pours and logistics to mitigate cold-joint risks in larger placements required sophisticated scheduling and resource coordination strategies.
\end{challenges}

\begin{dailynotes}
On request, I can prepare a concise cross-reference table (position, description, unit, A/B/C) by drawing/area and propose joint spacing/depth examples based on slab panel sizes.
