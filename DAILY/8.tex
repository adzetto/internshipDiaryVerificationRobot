\textbf{Morning Activities (09:00 – 12:30):} I turned the `MATERIALS` folder into a working dossier that links engineering quantities, tender metadata, and financial narratives. I started with the Arsuz Mechanical Separation facility metraj workbook and mapped its structure sheet by sheet. I verified that the discipline tabs feed a consolidated summary without broken formulas, paid attention to unit conventions across sheets, and wrote down how each measurement should be taken in practice. For excavation and backfill I clarified whether quantities are recorded as bank m³ or compacted fill, and I explained how bulking and shrinkage factors must be handled to avoid double counting. For concrete I connected class selection to exposure categories and cover requirements, and for reinforcement I described how bar schedules translate to linear meters and kilograms by diameter, including lap splices and waste factors.

I then reviewed the BOTAŞ project summary form and checked whether commercial assumptions are explicit enough for pricing. I noted where the scope statement needs clearer interfaces, where provisional sums should be separated from measured work, and where geotechnical categories and utility relocations could shift risk. I wrote a compact assumptions and exclusions block so that tender clarifications can track back to the estimate transparently. Finally, I skimmed the finance documents and reconciled their cost-driver story with what the metraj implies about materials, equipment, and labor over time. Where finance assumes aggressive productivity or procurement terms, I flagged those spots in the dossier for supervisor review.

\textbf{Afternoon Activities (13:30 – 17:45):} I converted the notes into repeatable checksheets and a simple document flow so the team can move from quantities to payment and pricing with fewer reworks. The metraj checklist focuses on drawing references, measurement methods, deductions, units, and conversions, then ties each group of items to the green ledger’s A/B/C logic. The assumptions log captures clarifications, answers, and their impact on quantities or unit rates, while the risk snippet flags uncertainties that could affect schedule or cost. I also drew a compact flow diagram to show how each document feeds the next step.

\textbf{Today’s Deliverable (Office):} The outcome is a navigable dossier that explains how quantities are measured, how assumptions are managed, and how finance ties back to engineering. The files now lead naturally from metraj to ledger reconciliation and onward to tender pricing with a single source of truth and a clear audit trail.

\begin{skillslearned}
\item[] I practiced structuring heterogeneous documents into a coherent flow that preserves traceability from drawings to quantities and from quantities to pricing. I reinforced careful reading of metraj with unit discipline, deduction logic, and conversion accuracy, and I learned to make assumptions and exclusions explicit so tender clarifications modify the estimate in a controlled way. I also improved financial cross-checking by comparing productivity and price assumptions against what the quantities and sequence logically permit.
\end{skillslearned}

\begin{challenges}
\item[] Maintaining unit consistency across sources required disciplined notation and a single conversions table. Keeping finance aligned with evolving metraj without version drift was challenging and led me to log changes explicitly with dates and impacts. The most intricate part was surfacing ambiguous scope items early and turning them into crisp questions that could be answered before they distorted either quantities or prices.
\end{challenges}

\begin{dailynotes}
Next step: apply the metraj checklist to a sample area in the Arsuz plant (e.g., a representative trench and foundation set) and reconcile with the A/B/C green ledger. In parallel, evolve the BOTAŞ assumptions sheet into a tender Q\&A tracker so clarifications feed directly back into pricing.
